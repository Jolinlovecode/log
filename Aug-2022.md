## Resolve github commits problem
## Problem: Commits not showing up on GitHub contributions graph but show against my repository.

# Reason: mismatch between my local Git email address and the email on my GitHub account

## Solution: 
- On your local machine, open terminal and run the command:git config user.email  to check what's your git address
- In my case, run the command in the terminal: git config --global user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
