### React 
- Component is function, return JSX code;
- Event is function 
 
  Just point at the function, pass a pointer at this function as a value to event.React basically memorizes it and executes the function for us whenever event occurs.
  It isn't executed when JXS is evaluated.
  Don't execute event (add parentheses following function name)
