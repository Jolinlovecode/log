### React 
#### Component is function, return JSX code;
#### Event is function 
 
  - Just point at the function, pass a pointer at this function as a value to event.React basically memorizes it and executes the function for us whenever event occurs.
  - It isn't executed when JXS is evaluated.
  - Don't execute event (add parentheses following function name)

#### useState
  - useState returns an array with 2 elements, and we're using ES6 destructuring to assign names to them. The first element is the current value of the state, and the second element is a state setter function â€“ just call it with a new value, and the state will be set and the component will re-render;
  - Calling useState again will simply create a new state.
